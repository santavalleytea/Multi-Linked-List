# Multi-Type Linked List (MTLL)

## Overview
The Multi-Type Linked List (MTLL) is a versatile data structure implemented in C, designed to handle different types of data including integers, floats, characters, strings, and nested lists. This implementation allows users to create, manipulate, and view complex nested structures dynamically. The main functionalities include adding, removing, and inserting elements, as well as viewing lists in different formats.

## Files
- `main.c`: Contains the main program logic and interface for interacting with the data structure.
- `mtll.c`: Implementation of the MTLL data structure and its associated functions.
- `mtll.h`: Header file for the MTLL implementation, defining structures and function prototypes.
